# Responsive Design Enhancement TODO

## Overview
Enhance the website's responsiveness for all devices: mobile (<768px), tablet/iPad (768px-1024px), laptop (1024px-1440px), and desktop (>1440px). This involves adding or improving media queries in CSS files to adjust layouts, font sizes, padding, and grid columns.

## Components to Update
- [x] Header (header.css)
- [x] Home (home.css)
- [x] About (about.css)
- [x] Features (features.css)
- [ ] Benefits (benefits.css)
- [ ] Normal (normal.css)
- [ ] ChooseShipTap (chooseShipTap.css)
- [ ] Contact (contact.css) - Already has good coverage, minor tweaks if needed
- [ ] Footer (footer.css)
- [ ] Wishlist (wishlist.css)

## Breakpoints
- Mobile: max-width: 767px
- Tablet/iPad: min-width: 768px and max-width: 1023px
- Laptop: min-width: 1024px and max-width: 1439px
- Desktop: min-width: 1440px

## Changes Needed
- Adjust font sizes for readability
- Modify padding and margins for spacing
- Change grid layouts (e.g., single column on mobile, multi-column on larger screens)
- Ensure navigation and buttons are touch-friendly on mobile
- Optimize image and video sizing

## Testing
- [ ] Test on mobile emulator
- [ ] Test on tablet emulator
- [ ] Test on laptop/desktop
